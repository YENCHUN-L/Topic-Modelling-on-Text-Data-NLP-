# Topic-Modelling-on-Text-Data-NLP-

The aim of this project is to do the following :
1) Find the optimal Number of hidden Topics in the reviews.
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning(LDA) to find out what the Topics are
3) Dictionary based Approach to classify text into representing chosen topics
4) Supervised Machine Learning(TF-IDF) to get deeper understanding based on parameters of Data.

This information, when presented to the user by classifying reviews into various relevant categories, can
prove to be very effective in making an informed decision. Although, the desired approach of this work is
useful for any kind of business, in this case we limit the scope of our classifier to only restaurants.

Since a review can be associated with multiple categories at the same time, it is not a binary classification
or a multi-class classification. It is rather a multi-label classification problem.
